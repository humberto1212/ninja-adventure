# Ninja Adventure
## Description
Be a ninja! ü•∑üèΩ <br/>
Jump and run over different buildings, but be careful, your speed will progressively increase and you may hit a wall.
Use **SPACE** to jump. Sometimes you may feel like you can fly but gravity plays an important role in this game so calculate well when jumping.

# MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
* The character can jump but cannot remain suspended in the air.
* The collision against objects is only valid if it is a frontal impact.
* Objects appear randomly and indefinitely.
* The character's ability to walk on structures and fall once he/she is no longer on the structure.

## Backlog
* Implement different types of movements depending on whether the character is on the ground or in the air.
* Design and implement new structures and new objects.
* Be able to enter a name and compare ratings with friends.
